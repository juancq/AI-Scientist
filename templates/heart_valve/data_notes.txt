Dataset name 
Aortic valve replacement surgery data

Description
This is longitudinal data on an observational study on detecting effects of different heart valves, differing on type of tissue, implanted in the aortic position. The data consists of longitudinal measurements on three different heart function outcomes, after surgery occurred. There are several baseline covariates available, and also survival data.

Format
This is a data frame in the unbalanced format, that is, with one row per observation. The data consists in columns for patient identification, time of measurements, longitudinal multiple longitudinal measurements, baseline covariates, and survival data. The column names are identified as follows:

num
number for patient identification.

sex
gender of patient (0=Male and 1=Female).

age
age of patient at day of surgery (years).

time
observed time point, with surgery date as the time origin (years).

fuyrs
maximum follow up time, with surgery date as the time origin (years).

status
censoring indicator (1=died and 0=lost at follow up).

grad
valve gradient at follow-up visit.

log.grad
natural log transformation of grad.

lvmi
left ventricular mass index (standardised) at follow-up visit.

log.lvmi
natural log transformation of lvmi.

ef
ejection fraction at follow-up visit.

bsa
preoperative body surface area.

lvh
preoperative left ventricular hypertrophy.

prenyha
preoperative New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification (1=I/II and 3=III/IV).

redo
previous cardiac surgery.

size
size of the valve (millimeters).

con.cabg
concomitant coronary artery bypass graft.

creat
preoperative serum creatinine (Î¼mol/mL).

dm
preoperative diabetes.

acei
preoperative use of ace inhibitor.

lv
preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (1=good, 2=moderate, and 3=poor).

emergenc
operative urgency (0=elective, 1 = urgent, and 3=emergency).

hc
preoperative high cholesterol (0=absent, 1 =present treated, and 2=present untreated).

sten.reg.mix
aortic valve haemodynamics (1=stenosis, 2=regurgitation, 3=mixed).

hs
implanted aortic prosthesis type (1=homograft and 0=stentless porcine tissue).
